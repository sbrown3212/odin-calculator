# Odin-Calculator

## Description

This was the final project of The Odin Project: Fundamentals course, which as the name implies, teaches the fundamentals of web development. In order to showcase the recently learned skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students were tasked with building a calculator. This included making a user interface with HTML and CSS, and coding the logic and behavior with JavaScript.

## Languages Used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

## How to use

The app was designed to be pretty self-explanatory, based on the appearance and user experience of a basic handheld calculator. The user can begin by clicking the number buttons, then an arithmetic operator (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and then more number buttons. Once those three elements are showing in the display, the equals button can be clicked and the result will show in the display. If the user wishes to use the result in their next equation, click an arithmetic operator and then a second number followed by the equals button again. Otherwise, with a result in the display, just begin inputting the first number and the result from the previous equation will be replaced with the new numbers that were clicked, and continue like normal.

## Future Fixes

As with may of my previous projects with The Odin Project, I don't have enough experience to know what the best practices are. The logic behind the way I designed this calculator has the value of the buttons clicked added to the display, and then the values in the display determines what is first number, operator, and second number gets assigned as. If I were to do it over, I would try using the value of the buttons clicked by the user to give the variables for the equation their value, and then update the display using the variables.

Also, I still need work understanding when helper functions should be used, instead of cramming too much into one function. I did not have to repeat code often in this project, but there were a number of times that the code could have been cleaned up by creating a function and just calling the function multiple times instead of copying and pasting the same few lines of code over and over again.

## Reflection

I am convinced that, as with many things in life, the purpose of learning is to add more "tools" to your tool belt, so that when new challenges come along, you are more equipped to take them on. It is great to see progress in my abilities as I "acquire" new "tools". I find that I am not getting stumped nearly as often in these later projects compared to the earlier ones. It is gratifying to see progress.
